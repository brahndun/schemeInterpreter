All "TO:DOs" were coded in and tested
Eval and Apply methods were heavily based on the hints that prof GB gave out in class.
The BuiltIn class took a while to code in, but eventually the structure was nailed down on paper
 and translated to code (separating by arguments and calling them)
Environment was built based on the hints given in class with assign and define.
Closure apply took a helper method that parsed its parameters and arguments for empty cons nodes
 and returns a closure with the rest(body) and the function environment.
All these methods were tested out individually and worked.
There are test prints spread throughout the special and tree folders (used to see where it died)
